# Automated DCF Valuation Engine

A financial modeling tool built in Python to determine the intrinsic value of publicly traded companies.

### Technical Implementation
* **Data Sourcing**: Uses `yfinance` to extract real-time Free Cash Flow from company balance sheets.
* **Mathematical Model**: Implements a 5-year growth projection and discounts cash flows back to present value using a 10% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).

### Why I Built This
Coming from a Mechanical Engineering background at IIT Madras, I wanted to apply system modeling principles—where we predict future outputs based on current efficiency—to the world of finance.
